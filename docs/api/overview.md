# API Overview

The ClickNPS API is organized around REST principles. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes.

## Base URL

```
https://api.clicknps.com/v1
```

## Authentication

The ClickNPS API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [Dashboard](/settings/api-keys).

```bash
curl https://api.clicknps.com/v1/surveys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

> ðŸ”‘ **API Key Format:** All API keys start with `sk_live_` for production or `sk_test_` for test mode.

## Rate Limits

| Plan | Requests/min | Requests/hour |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| Free | 60 | 1,000 |
| Pro | 600 | 10,000 |
| Enterprise | Unlimited | Unlimited |

When you exceed the rate limit, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "rate_limit_exceeded",
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Retry after 60 seconds."
  }
}
```

    "limit": 10,

```

  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: unique-key-123" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
